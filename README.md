# Van Life

This is a website renting vans to customers. It has host section which hosts could add or remove vans that they want to rent out. (IMPORTANT NOTE: The webpage is about testing login logic and data fetching right now. 'Rent a van' button under vans are not functional yet.) It's built using React, Redux, and Firebase,(also MirageJS), leveraging React Router for navigation. This is a personal learning project aiming to combine react-router, redux, and backend responses.
